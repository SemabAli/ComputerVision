# Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)

A GAN is a generative model that is built by making two networks compete. One network, called a generator,  tries to generate data while the other,  called a discriminator, try to flag the generated data as fake data. The goal is for the generator to learn to fool the discriminator into flagging the generated data as real.
